The links above show the documentation for the motor drivers and line sensor array that we used in the robot.
We shorted the sensor so it is 3.3 volts.
Once these are connnected to the board the robot should traverse the maze and return the correct path.
You can place the car back in the maze a second time, and it will use the correct path.
The engineering of the chassis included two wheels and half of a ping pong ball that drags along the ground behind it.
We attached the bread board with a ribbon cable attached to the raspberry pi behind it.
We also attached a weight to the front of the car.
We used a 9-volt d-battery to power the board and an external power supply to power the raspberry pi.
After the robot makes a U-turn, respond to the prompt in the code to continue.
The biggest problem we encountered was with the motors and finding a consistent power supply.
As for the criteria requested:
- Can folow a straight line
- Can follow a bent line
- Can retrace it's path at the end of the line
- The target is definded by a string that consists of 1s and 0s that will tell it what type of line it has encountered
- The vehicle can find it's target
- The algortithm used to find the target is in code section of our repositories as sensor.py
- The vehcile can retrace it's path once the target is reached
- The vehicle construction is clean
- The code is organized and commented
