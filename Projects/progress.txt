	Our final project is Maze Solver. We were assigned to make a robot vehicle that learns maze traversal directions using a reflectance sensor array. When placed in a maze, the robot will solve and learn the maze beginning at a given location.
	The equipment we have aquired so far includes a 4-wheel chasis with motors, two Dual H-Bridge motor drivers, a battery pack to power the motors, our raspberry pi, a LED senor array, a breadboard, and wires.
	So far we have assembled the chasis and wired the breadboard with one of the motor drivers. We have also ran a script through the raspberry pi to make sure we knew our breadboard was wired correctly. Over the next three weeks we hope to accomplish the following. If not finish the project entirely, we would like the robot to be able to at least be able to traverse the maze once using left turns. We are currently working on implementing the reflectance sensor array.
	Each partner in our group has been or is going to be heavily involved in most aspects of our project. Sylum has assisted in the assmebly of the chasis and provided scrpits on the pi to test the motor driver. He will continue to be involved with the code we plan to use to solve the maze(s). Chris has primarily been involved in the wiring and testing of the motor drivers, and will also be working with the sensor array and code. Max had also assisted in the assembly of the chassis, some work with wiring, and was in charge of the write-up of this report. He will also be involved with any future code we plan to use for this assignment.
